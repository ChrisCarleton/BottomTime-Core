# Dive Sites APIs

## Classes
### DiveSite Object
Describes a dive site.

```json
{
	"siteId": "String: A unique ID identifying the dive site in the database.",
	"owner": "String: Username of the user who created the dive site record.",
	"score": "Number: Returned when performing searches. Indicates how well the document scored as a result candidate.",
	"name": "REQUIRED String: The name of the site. (Max 200 characters.)",
	"location": "String: The location, town, city, etc. where the dive site is located. (Max 100 characters.)",
	"country": "String: The name of the country in which the dive site is located. (Max 100 characters.)",
	"water": "String: One of 'fresh' or 'salt'.",
	"accessibility": "String: One of 'shore' or 'boat'.",
	"entryFee": "Boolean: True if the site is a private location where you have to pay to dive there.",
	"difficulty": "Number: Difficulty rating 1-5. 1 = Suitable for beginners, 5 = Expert/technical divers only.",
	"description": "String: A free-form description of the site. (Max 1000 characters.)",
	"tags": [
		"String: An array of tags to help in searching for dive sites. (E.g. deep, drift, good vis, etc.)"

		"lat": "REQUIRED Number: Latitude of the dive site. Must be between -90.0 and 90.0."
	}
}
```
**Notes:** The `siteId`, `score`, and `owner` properties are ignored when creating and updating dive
sites. On creation, the site ID will be generated and the owner will be set to the user who created the
site.

All dive sites are publicly visible. They are meant to be shared among users.

### DiveSiteRating Object
Describes a user's rating of a dive site.

```json
{
	"ratingId": "String: The unique ID for the dive site rating.",
	"user": "String: The user who submitted this rating.",

	"comments": "String: Free form comments the user wrote about the dive site. (Max 1000 characters.)"
}
```

**Notes:** The `ratingId`, `user` and `date` fields should be omitted when submitting dive site ratings.
They will be generated by the server.

## Routes
### GET /diveSites
This route is for listing or searching for dive sites in the database.

#### Query Parameters
* **query** - A search term to search for in the database. This will perform a full-text search over the
`name`, `location`, `description`, and `tags` fields.
* **closeTo** - A geographical location around which dive sites should be searched. Should be specified
in the format: `[longitude,latitude]`. E.g. `[-86.94527777777778,20.5030556]` (Cozumel, Mexico.)
* **distance** - Can be used with **closeTo** to indicate how far away from the indicated location dive
sites should be searched. **distance** must be a number representing how many kilometers from the location
will be considered in the search. The default is `50`; the maximum is `1000`.
* **count** - Number of records to return. The default is `250`; the maximum is `1000`.
* **skip** - Number of records to skip over before returning results. (Useful for pagination.) Default is
`0`.
* **water** - Allows filtering by type of water. Valud values are `salt` and `fresh`.
* **accessibility** - Allows filtering by shore/boat access. Valid values are `shore` and `boat`.
* **avoidEntryFee** - If true, will filter out dive sites where you need to pay to dive there. Valid
values are `true` or `false`.
* **maxDifficulty** - Will filter out dive sites with difficulty ratings above the indicated value. Must
be a number between `1.0` and `5.0`.
* **minRating** - Will filter out dive sites with an average user rating below the indicated value. Must
be a number between `1.0` and `5.0`.
* **owner** - Only show dive sites submitted by specified specified user.
* **sortOrder** - The order in which results are returned. Must be `asc` or `desc`. (The default is `asc`.)
* **sortBy** - The field on which to sort the results. Valid values are `relevance` (the default),
`difficulty`, and `rating`.

**Notes:** If `distance` is supplied then `closeTo` is required. Supplying `distance` without `closeTo`
will result in a 400 Bad Request error.
