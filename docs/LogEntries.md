# Log Entries
The log entries domain deals with log entries in a user's log book.

## Classes
### LogEntry Object
Describes a single log entry from a user's log book.

```json
{
	"entryId": "String: A globally-unique ID that identifies the log entry. (Generated upon creation.)",
	"entryTime": "REQUIRED String: A Date and Time in ISO 8601 format",
	"location": "REQUIRED String: Up to 200 characters",
	"site": "REQUIRED String: Up to 200 characters",
	"gps": {  // Optional object
		"latitude": "REQUIRED Number: Between -90.0 and 90.0",
		"longitude": "REQUIRED Number: Between -180.0 and 180.0"
	},
	"bottomTime": "Number: Bottom time minutes (must be positive)",
	"totalTime": "Number: Total dive time, including ascent/stops (must be positive and >= 'bottomTime')",
	"averageDepth": "Number: Average depth in meters",
	"maxDepth": "Number: Maximum depth in meters (must be >= 'averageDepth')",
	"weight": {  // Optional object
		"amount": "Number: Amount of weight worn in kilograms."
	}
}
```
#### Notes:
`entryId` is generated by the database when log entries are first saved. It should **not** be included in
`POST` requests but **must** be included in `PUT` requests.

### LogEntrySummary Object
An abbreviated version of a [LogEntry](#logentry-object) object. It contains fewer properties and is
suitable to be returned in queries for many log entries.

```json
{
	"entryId": "String: A globally-unique ID that identifies the log entry.",
	"entryTime": "String: A Date and Time in ISO 8601 format",
	"location": "String: Up to 200 characters",
	"site": "String: Up to 200 characters",
	"bottomTime": "Number: Bottom time minutes",
	"maxDepth": "Number: Maximum depth in meters"
}
```

## Routes
### GET /users/:userName/logs
Queries a user's log book for log entries.

#### Route Parameters
* **userName** - Name of the user whose log book the entries will be queried from.

#### Query Parameters
* **count** - Maximum number of records to return in the query. Can be any number between 1 and 1000.
* **sortBy** - The field on which the returned entries should be sorted. Allowed values are **entryTime**,
**bottomTime**, and **maxDepth**. The default is **entryTime**.
* **sortOrder** - The order in which sorted entries should be returned. Allowed values are **asc**
(ascending order), and **desc** (descending order.) The default value is **desc**.
* **lastSeen** - For searches where some results have already been shown, the **lastSeen** value should be
set to the entryTime, maxDepth, or bottomTime (depending on the value of the **sortBy** parameter) of the
last entry returned in the previous query. This tells the API that the search should resume at or beyond
that value.
* **seenIds** - For searches where some results have already been show, the **seenIds** value should be
set to an array of entryIds that should be excluded from the results. Example: A search was made for entries
ordered by bottomTime in descending order. The last entry returned had a bottomTime of 38 minutes. To
continue getting more results **lastSeen** should be set to 38, and **seenIds** should be a comma-separated
list of all entry Ids that have already been returned where bottomTime is 38 minutes (so that they are not
repeated in the next set of results.)

**NOTE:** The **sortBy** and **sortOrder** parameters are a pair. If one is included in the query string,
then the other is also required.
